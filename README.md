# Flood Resilience Dashboard ðŸŒ¾

A Streamlit-based dashboard for computing Flood Resilience Index (FRI), predicting crop yield, and exploring scenario analysis at the division level using Ridge, RandomForest, and CatBoost models with SHAP explainability.

---

## Features

- Compute Flood Stress Indices (FSIs) from crop and environmental data.
- Predict expected and actual crop yield using multiple ML models.
- Calculate Flood Resilience Index (FRI) and classify risk levels (Low, Medium, High).
- Explore global and local SHAP explanations for model interpretability.
- Scenario analysis with sliders for precipitation, soil wetness, temperature, and wind.
- Download CSV report for selected division and year.
